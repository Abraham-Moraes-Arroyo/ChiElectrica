This is a page that I have made for an electric company
I have made this web page utilizing replit, github, githubpages, bootstrap, Stack Overflow, and w3schools. 
I have simply used different pieces of code in order to visualize and make an idea become possible. 
I don't intend to make money off the following companies or the webpages. I have taken different templates that 
these companies, which I have mentioned, have created and added my own twist and utilized them to come up to 
create something new. I have linked below where generally I would have found solutions to my problems when programming: 

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/
https://github.com/
https://stackoverflow.com/
https://www.w3schools.com/

The web page is very simple, and it doesn't have any of CSS. Rather it has mostly typescript

If any of the webpage that I have created utilizing template code and code of my own interests any of you, you 
are allowed to utilize it, but you can not make any profit out of the code/ creation. 
Have a nice rest of your day, and be safe.
